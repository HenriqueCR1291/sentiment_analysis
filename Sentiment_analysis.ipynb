On paper, it is a great service, however - the lack of any ability to set reminders using google assistant means that half of the app is a waste of money, if that is your main way of working. Disappointingly - I was automatically charged for a yearly subscription before I realised, and the developers refused to provide a refund. Unfortunately I would recommend just sticking with google assistant. Not worth the money. *caveat- if this google assistant functionality was added - that could make it worthwhile. is there a plan to fix that?',\n",

Also, the pop-ups and list don't sync. So, if I delete a to do on the list in the app, the pop-up remains. I'd also like to be able to remove a batch of to dos at once. The features outweigh the frustrations for me with this app, and I do depend on it daily. I've been using this app for years and loved it... until the last couple of weeks. It has stopped notifying me when a task is due. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, and it works for one day and then stops again. I need an app that notifies me.
